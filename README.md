# P7-Groupomania
Groupomania is the seventh project for my formation at <a href="https://openclassrooms.com/">OpenClassrooms</a>, its a ***Social Network***.

## Prerequisites :
### <ol><li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js </a></li><li><a href="https://git-scm.com">Git </a>(not essential)</li><li><a href="mongodb.com">MongoDB </a>to make a database</li></ol>

## How to start :

- ### First steps, you need to clone this project with this command : `git clone <ssh-url> or <https-url>`
  (or just download the zip folder)

- ### Then, you need to go in the "back" folder, open a new terminal
  ### (`CTRL + L, write "cmd", and press ENTER`) and use this command : `npm install`
- ### Make a `.env` file and past your database ids like this : 
  `DB_USERNAME=<your_db_username>`

  `DB_PASSWORD=<your_db_password>`
  
  `SECRET_TOKEN=SECRET_RANDOM_TOKEN_KEY`

- ### Start the back using this command : `node app.js`
- ### In the "front" folder you just need to do `npm install`(to install node_modules) and `npm start` to start the front

# I hope you'll enjoy my project

⚠️ To do this project I had a limited time, so it is not perfect but it respects what was requested for this project.
